# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains the files for the Portfolio task for COMP2200/6200 in S2 2021. 

## Portfolio 1
We explored and analysed a cycler's personal data between road races and timed trials.


## Portfolio 2
We explore data from the Federal Government [Sport Vouchers program](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-sa-14daba50-04ff-46c6-8468-9fa593b9f100/details). This is a program that provides up to two $100 vouchers for kids to participate in organised sport.

To augment this data we also used [ABS SEIFA data by LGA](http://stat.data.abs.gov.au/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ABS_SEIFA_LGA#) which shows a few measures of Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage for every Local Government Area. This allowed us to answer questions about whether the voucher program was used equally by parents in low, middle and high socioeconomic areas


## Portfolio 3
We explored and analysed mobile customer churn data to predict whether a customer would churn (leave the mobile provider). This was generated by Hume Winzar at Macquarie based on a real dataset provided by Optus.
